This is a project I made to practice and understand Javascript. Current iteration 
of the project contains implentations of the Array, Date, Function, Math, Number, 
Object, and String prototype methods. Most methods are implemented without 
using other methods of the same prototype. Some methods are missing as they are 
not recreatable in Javascript (Object.freeze and toLocaleString for example). 

Other common computer science algorithms are also included.
